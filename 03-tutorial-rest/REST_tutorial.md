# REST API

In this tutorial you will practive how to interact with REST APIs.

## Building a REST API with FastAPI

In this section we will create a REST API layer for the Database that we built in the [Data Management Tutorial](../02-tutorial-data-management/Data_Management_Tutorial.md)
We will create API endpoints for the entities Samples, Participants and Diagnosis that we already developed (toghether with the related databaase) during the SQLAlchemy tutorial.

The REST API is composed of several levels of services: 
  - **Controllers**: they are the entrypoints of the API. They receive the requests from the client and call the services to perform the operations
  - **Services**: they contain the business logic of the application. They call the repositories to perform the operations on the database
  - **DTOs**: they are the Data Transfer Objects, the classes used to model the bodies of the requests and the responses of the API. 

### Steps 

1. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn in the virtualenv of the project
   
   **NB: remember to activate the virtualenv with `source venv/bin/activate`**

   ```bash
   pip install "fastapi[standard]"
   pip install uvicorn
   ```

1. In the biobank_manager project add the `controllers` package under the biobank_manager directory, with three files (moreover the `__init__.py`):
    - `participants.py`: it will contain the controllers for the participants
    - `samples.py`: it will contain the controllers for the samples
    - `diagnosis.py`: it will contain the controllers for the diagnosis

1. Let's implement together the participants' controllers. Add this code to the `participants.py`

   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
   from starlette import status
   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
   from biobank_manager.database import get_db

   from biobank_manager.services import participants
   from biobank_manager.dtos.participants import ParticipantReadDTO, ParticipantCreateDTO

   # Handles the endpoints that start with `/participants` (e.g., POST /participants, GET /participants, GET /participants/{id})
   router = APIRouter(
     prefix="/participants",
     tags=["Participant"],
   )


   # Implements the POST action for participants
   @router.post(
     "",  # empty means it is handling POST participants (router prefix + "")
     response_model=ParticipantReadDTO,  # DTO of the response. FastAPI will serialize as JSON by default
     response_description="Add a new participant",  # Description for the swagger endpoint
     status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED  # The status code in case the operation is ok (i.e., no exception are raised)
   )
   def create_participant(
     participant_create_dto: ParticipantCreateDTO,  # DTO of the request (FastAPI will generate the object from the JSON sent from the client)
     db: Session = Depends(get_db)  # FastAPI will take care of passing the Session returned by the get_db function
   ):
     p = participants.add_participant(db, participant_create_dto)  # Simply call 
     return p.to_participant_read_dto()
   ```

   This code defines a FastAPI router for the participants API. It includes a POST endpoint to create a new participant, which uses a DTO for input validation and returns a DTO for the response.
   Notice the call to the service (`participants.add_participant`) that relates to what we will define at 4.

3. In the same way, create a new package called dtos under the biobank_manager directory, with three files:
    - samples.py: it will contain the DTO models for the samples
    - participants.py: it will contain the DTO models for the participants
    - diagnosis.py: it will contain the DTO models for the diagnosis

   The DTO models are related to the API input and output operations: it means that when an endpoint, for example 
   a POST to add new samples, will receive the data from the incoming request, it will use the DTO model to validate the data.
   In the same way, there will be a DTO model to return the data to the client.
   For example, in the DTO module for the participants, there will be:

   ```python
   class ParticipantCreateDTO(BaseModel):
     last_name: str = Field(title="Last name of the participant")
     first_name: str = Field(title="First name of the participant")
     date_of_birth: date = Field(title="Date of birth of the participant in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)")
     place_of_birth: str = Field(title="Place of birth of the participant")
     ssn: str = Field(title="Social Security Number of the participant")
     gender: str = Field("Gender of the participant")
 
   class ParticipantReadDTO(ParticipantCreateDTO):
     id: int = Field(title="Unique identifier for the participant")
     model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)   
    ```
    
   Notice that we do not want to set the IDs in the DTOs, because they are generated by the database. To do that, 
   remember to assign the attribute "autoincrement=True" to the id field in the SQLAlchemy model, so that the database will generate the ID automatically.
   The `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` is used to allow the DTO to be created from the SQLAlchemy model.

4. Now, create a new package called services under the biobank_manager directory, with three files:
    - samples.py: it will contain the services for the samples
    - participants.py: it will contain the services for the participants
    - diagnosis.py: it will contain the services for the diagnosis
   
    The services will contain the business logic of the application, they will perform operations on the database.
    For example, in the services module for the participants, there will be:
    ```python
   from biobank_manager.database.models import Participant
   from biobank_manager.dtos.participants import ParticipantCreateDTO
   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

   def add_participant(db:Session, participant_create_dto: ParticipantCreateDTO):
      participant = Participant(**participant_create_dto.model_dump())  # unpack DTO fields into model
      db.add(participant)
      db.commit()
      db.refresh(participant)  # refresh to get the auto-generated ID
      return participant
5. Now, notice that both controller and participant service use this db object, that refers to the
   logic used by SqlAlchemy to interact with the database. Actually we don't have created it yet,
   let's do it by adding the following code to the database/__init__.py file:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

   from biobank_manager import DATABASE_URL

   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)

   SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

   Base = declarative_base()

   def get_db() -> Session:
      db = SessionLocal()
      try:
        yield db  # use as a generator for cleanup
      finally:
        db.close()
   ```
   Notice that this configuration will be valid for all the APIs and all the related objects.
   In order to test this API for participants, what is missing right not is to add the modules
   that will run the FastAPI application. 
6. Create a new file called app.py in the biobank_manager directory with the following code:
   ```python
   from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
   from biobank_manager.database import Base, engine
   from biobank_manager import router as participant_router

    app = FastAPI(
       title="Biobank Manager API",
       version="1.0.0",
       description="Biobank manager API for managing biobank data",
    )
   
   @asynccontextmanager
   async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
      Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
      yield

   app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
   app.include_router(participant_router, prefix="/api", tags=["Participants"])

   ```
    This code initializes the FastAPI application, includes the participants router,
   and sets up the database tables at startup. Notice that you will have to add the other routers
   for samples and diagnosis in the same way as the participants router (app.include_router calls).
7. Create now a run module to run the FastAPI application, for example in a file called start_api_server.py:
   ```python
   import uvicorn
   if __name__ == "__main__":
      uvicorn.run("biobank_manager.app:app", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, reload=True)
    ```
   Set the host and port values accordingly. 
8. Run the API server with the following command:
   ```bash
   python start_api_server.py
   ```
9. Now, let's test the only endpoint that we have created so far, the one to add a new participant.
   You can use a tool like Postman or the python requests library to test the API.
   Make a POST request to the endpoint http://[host]:[port]/api/participants/ with the following JSON body:
   ```json
   {
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "first_name": "John",
      "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
      "place_of_birth": "New York",
      "ssn": "DOEJHN90A01Z404E",
      "gender": "M"
   }
    ```
    If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a response with the created participant object, including the auto-generated ID:
       ```json
   {
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "first_name": "John",
      "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
      "place_of_birth": "New York",
      "ssn": "DOEJHN90A01Z404E",
      "gender": "M"
      "id": [progressively generated ID in your local database environment]
   }
    ```
10. Try to make the POST above twice, then check the database. What happens? Try to change the code 
    in a way to avoid this issue. 
11. Let's force a bad request, for example by missing the last_name field in the JSON body.
