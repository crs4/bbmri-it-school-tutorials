# Task 1.2: extend biobank schema

## Your task objective

1. Extend your biobank's schema to represent participant consent data.
2. Create and load some consent data.
3. Open the sample consents of your BIMS in Molgenis and verify that yout 
   consent data has been properly loaded.

## Instructions
In this task you will add consent data to some of your samples. For each sample, 
you'll register person's choice related to that sample, for a specific 
condition of use. 
In your BIMS, there are three entities related to consent: 

 - ConsentConditionsOntology: it is the ontology table containing the 
   8 CCEs related to samples consent
 - ConsentDecisionsOntology: id is the ontology table that contains the 
   possible decisions a participant can make for each CCE and for each sample
 - SampleConsents: it is the table that for each sample and CCE pair provides the
   participant's decision.

 This is the list of the possible CCEs in the ConsentConditionsOntology table:

| cce_id                         | cce_description                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| REGULATORY_JURISDICTION        | Use within an area defined by a shared legal framework (e.g. EU GDPR)                                                                                   |
| COMMERCIAL_USE                  | Use to make profit/Use by an entity in the commercial sector                                                                                            |
| RETURN_OF_RESULTS               | Use that involves a requirement on the recipient to return results that were intentionally generated by the planned use                                 |
| CONTACT_TO_PARTICIPATE          | Re-contact of the participant or patient for the purposes of requesting their collaboration or participation in future research (including clinical trials) |
| GENERATION_OF_BIOLOGICAL_PRODUCTS | Possibility of generation of IPSC, organoids, immortalized cells, from the participant's samples                                                        |
| RETURN_OF_INCIDENTAL_FINDINGS   | Use that involves a requirement on the recipient to return results that were not foreseen by the planned use, to the resource provider (or participant)  |
| DATA_LINKAGE                    | Association of clinical data to the samples                                                                                                            |
| DATA_SAMPLE_POST_MORTEM_REUSE   | The samples/data are available for research after death of participant                                                                                   |


Fot a group of samples, you can choose one or more CCEs (also all of them) and for eack CCEs
the related decision(PERMIT/DENY), and create a CSV file names SampleConsents.csv to load the data,
with this header:

```
sample_id,cce_id,decision_id
``` 
Once you have created the CSV file, load it in your BIMS with the "Up/Download " functionality in 
Molgenis. 
Finally, check that the data has been properly loaded by opening the SampleConsents table in Molgenis.
