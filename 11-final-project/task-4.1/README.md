# Task 4.1: Dockerize


## Your task objective

1. Create a single script to execute your entire ETL process
1. Create a Docker image to package your ETL process
2. Publish your new image on Docker Hub

## Instructions

## Part 1

These instructions are generic because we can't know in advance exactly what
solution you have created for your BB.

* You will at least have one script and a call to `blazectl.
* You could create a simple Bash script that executes in succession the various
  steps.
    * Take steps to catch errors, should they occur (e.g., enable `set -o
    errexit` in your Bash script)
* If you're using Python for your script(s), you can use an
[official Python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) as a base `FROM` which
to build your image.
    + The image is built on Debian Linux, so that `apt` package manager is
    available, if you should require it.
* Use `COPY` to copy your source code into the image.  Alternatively (better) you
  can install `git` and `git clone` your repository into the image (remember to
  clone without history).
    + **üìù Tip**: it's good practice to fix the commit ID you use to select the
      software version -- e.g., as a default value to an `ARG` called `revision`.
* Use this command in your Dockerfile to install `blazectl`:
```
`RUN curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samply/blazectl/main/install.sh | sh`
```
* If your container has a complex start up, implement an entrypoint script.
  Else, you can specify your script as the `CMD`.
* Ensure your image by default runs as a regular user, not as root (i.e.,
use the `USER` command.
* Test your image locally with `docker run`.  Don't forget to mount local file
directories as required to give your script access to data.


## Part 2

* Create an account on Docker Hub, if you don't already have one.
* Log in (i.e., `docker login`) from the VM, where you built the image.
* Tag the image appropriately, after which you should be able to `docker push`.
