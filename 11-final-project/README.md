# BBMRI IT School: Final Project

This final course project will give you the opportunity to **integrate your own
(toy) biobank** into a mock BBMRI-ERIC Federated Platform (FP).

The project is broken down into a set of tasks, which you must complete in
sequence.  In each task, there may be solutions suggested, but you should feel
free to do things your own way -- so long as you can achieve the objectives.
