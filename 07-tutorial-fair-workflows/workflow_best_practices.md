# Workflow Best Practices

## Introduction

Workflows are a powerful way to encapsulate complex data analyses in a reproducible manner. However, to ensure workflows remain usable over time, it's essential to follow best practices for testing, continuous integration, and maintenance. This tutorial will guide you through setting up tests for Galaxy workflows, automating these tests with GitHub Actions, and implementing maintenance automation using LifeMonitor.

            <strong>Applicability to Other Workflow Systems</strong><br>
            While this tutorial primarily focuses on Galaxy workflows, it's important to note that the best practices discussed hereâ€”testing, continuous integration, and maintenance automationâ€”apply to workflows developed with any workflow management system. The specific tools and commands may differ (e.g., replacing Planemo with the appropriate testing framework for your workflow manager), but the core principles remain the same. You can adapt these practices to NextFlow, Snakemake, CWL, or any other workflow system by substituting the appropriate tools and commands for your platform.
