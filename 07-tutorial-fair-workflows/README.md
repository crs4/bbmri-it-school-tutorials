# Building FAIR Workflows: A Practical Tutorial

This tutorial includes the practical exercises to accompany the FAIR workflows lecture.  Through its various sections, you'll practice how to create, document, and share computational workflows so that others can more easily discover, understand, and reuse them through the application of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

Go through these steps in order.

1. [Introduction to the Galaxy workflow manager](galaxy_workflows.md) - Creating and sharing reproducible workflows using the Galaxy platform
2. [RO-Crate](RO_crate.md) - Understanding the Research Object Crate model for packaging research data
3. [Workflow Best Practices](workflow_best_practices.md) - Guidelines for designing clear, maintainable, and reusable workflows
4. [Apache Airflow](apache_airflow.md) - Introduction to workflow orchestration and management with Apache Airflow
